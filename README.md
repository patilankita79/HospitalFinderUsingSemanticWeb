# HospitalFinderUsingSemanticWeb

The project aims to find the top five leading causes of death and once we find it, we address one of leading causes of death and suggest hospitals near to a user for that particular disease so that they can be cured if possible and we can reduce the death rate for that particular disease. For this purpose, data about "Potentially Excess Deaths from the Five Leading Causes of Death(NCHS)" from National Vital Statistics System is used and combined with the "Timely and Effective Care- Hospital" and "500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health" for the year 2014.
